## think about
* Future default global error
* A, B, E = A | B
* enabled: is T




## think about later
* default shallow equal check?
* behavior on error?
* observable from observable?
* destroy behavior?
* prefetchQuery & SSR


## maybe
* audit
* auditTime
* buffer
* bufferCount
* bufferTime
* bufferToggle
* debounce
* throttle
* defer
* delay
* delayWhen
* every
* find
* interval
* from
* range
* sample
* take
* takeUntil
* takeWhile
* timeInterval
